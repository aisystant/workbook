  1:
  - Strategist
  - Holds systems-oriented thinking concepts and avoids obvious ontological mistakes.
  - “Systems Self-Development”, “Self-Development Practices”, course “Introduction to Systems Thinking”
  - '2024'
  - Life mastery - 7, including thinking mastery – 6, applied mastery -8
  - Complete the course “Systems Thinking” by the end of the year in a joint learning group, apply it to a work project, and try to present the results at the 2025 conference. I think I also need to improve organization and practice rhetoric, as well as take applied courses in product management. Then I can increase my thinking mastery to 8 or 9 points, which will help me implement the "ABC" project faster. And the qualification will increase.
