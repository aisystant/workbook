  - '3'
  - At the time of graduation (15 years ago), I received a good education in logic, but it is now outdated, so I rate it a 3. Little of it is relevant now. Subsequently, I applied and learned somewhat in life, albeit unconsciously, so I add a 2. After training in this course, mastery has significantly improved, so I add another 3. However, a specialized course on modern logic is still needed.
